Books
=====

You have been tasked with writing Ruby code that parses two files of book meta-data (`source1.file` and `source2.file`), merges that data, and then outputs the result of the merge to another file (`result.file`). The resulting output should resemble `result_example.file`; however, the  order of values in arrays and key-value pairs in hashes are not important.

Clarifying-questions, use of online resources, and code libraries are all fair game.

You have 45 minutes to complete this task.
